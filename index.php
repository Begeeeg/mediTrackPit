          <!-- Description of the MediTrack system -->
          Medical Inventory System that will be automated using RFID technology
          and the ESP32 microprocessor. This system eliminates the need for
          manual tracking by providing real-time monitoring of medical supplies,
          ensuring that essential resources are always available when needed. By
          automating inventory management, MediTrack helps reduce human error,
          streamline hospital workflows, and allow healthcare professionals to
          focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks. By
          automating inventory workflows, MediTrack enhances hospital
          efficiency, it also helps to prevent supply wastage, and alleviates
          the administrative burden on healthcare professionals, enabling them
          to focus more on patient care. This improved efficiency not only
          reduces hassle but also contributes to better patient outcomes, making
          MediTrack a scalable and reliable solution for modern healthcare
          facilities.
          <br /><br />
          By leveraging modern technology, the system aims to enhance stock
          tracking, prevent supply shortages, and ultimately contribute to
          better patient outcomes. Moreover, through real-time analysis and
          reporting, MediTrack allows for hospital managers to make informed
          decisions, forecast supply needs, and increase inventory management.
          By using these technologies, this system makes healthcare facilities
          more efficient and dependable while enhancing patientsâ€™ healthcare
          results, optimizing available resources, and enabling a more agile
          medical supply chain. And also, through RFID technology and automated
          data processing, MediTrack ensures that hospitals maintain optimal
          stock levels, reducing the risks associated with manual tracking
          errors. The system continuously updates inventory records, allowing
          hospital staff to instantly access supply information, locate
          essential medical items, and prevent delays in patient care. By
          streamlining inventory processes and improving supply chain agility,
          MediTrack ensures that hospitals operate efficiently,
          cost-effectively, and with a stronger focus on patient care,
          ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
